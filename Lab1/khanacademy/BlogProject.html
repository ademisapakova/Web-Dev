<h2 id="dreams">About dreams</h2>
<h6>26 Sep 2022</h6>

<p>


    Dreams are just images from the subconscious that show us certain things/internal processes. It never means anything literal.<br>
    That is, a dream is always a symbol, not a prediction, etc. Or even if the dream is trying to tell you something about the future it will be a symbol.</p>
