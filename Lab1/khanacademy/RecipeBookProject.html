<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Heat the oil and butter in a medium saucepan. Fry the onion over a low heat for 10 mins or until softened and translucent.
</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add the mushrooms and cook for 10 mins over a medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for 2 mins. Add the wine and bring to a simmer, reduce the liquid by half.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add the double cream and bring to a simmer, then add the lemon zest and parmesan. Season with salt and plenty of black pepper.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Meanwhile, cook the pasta following pack instructions. Reserve 100ml of the pasta water. Toss the pasta in the pan with the creamy sauce and enough of the reserved water to loosen. Stir through the parsley, divide into bowls and top with extra cheese, if you like.

    <td>150g</td>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Tip the sushi rice into a medium saucepan, cover with 200ml water and add a pinch of salt. Put the pan on the hob and turn the heat to high. Wait for the water to boil, then reduce the heat to very low, cover the pan with a lid and leave to gently cook for 15 mins.
</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After 15 mins turn off the heat, fluff up the rice with a fork, then return the lid to the pan and leave for another 5 mins, the rice will continue to cook. After 5 mins, check the rice is cooked – it should have absorbed all the water and be soft but not mushy. Stir the sugar and vinegar through the rice, cover with the lid again and leave to keep warm while you prepare the other ingredients.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Thinly slice the radishes. Cut the cucumber into batons, then thinly slice lengthways. Break the salmon into small pieces – look out for any bones and throw these away.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Divide the warm rice between two bowls and arrange the other ingredients on top, then drizzle with the soy sauce and sesame seeds, and add a few pieces of sushi ginger, if using.
