<h1> I can wait for you very much</h1>
<p> I can wait for you very much<br>
    Very long and very faithfully<br>
    And I can stay awake at nights<br>
    A year, and two, and all my life, probably <br>
    Let the leaves of the calendar<br>
    Will fly around like foliage by a garden,<br>
    I'd only like to know that everything is not in vain,<br>
    That you really want this!
